# Filtering in array
#Filtering means selecting specific elements from an array based on certain conditions.
#  The selected elements are used to create a new array.
#  filtering is done using Boolean indexing. This means we create a list of True and False values, where:
#True means we keep that element in the new array.
#False means we remove that element
#  Manually Creating a Filter
arr = np.array([41, 42, 43, 44])
# Boolean list that decides which elements to keep
filter_arr = [True, False, True, False]
# Apply the filter
newarr = arr[filter_arr]
print(newarr)  # Output: [41, 43]
# Creating a Filter Using a Conditio
#  keep only numbers greater than 42.

# Apply the filter
newarr = arr[filter_arr]
print(filter_arr)  # Output: [False, False, True, True]
print(newarr)  # Output: [43, 44]

# Broadcasting in NumPy is a way of performing operations on 
# arrays of different sizes without needing to manually change their shapes.
#when performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, 
#both arrays should have the same shape (size and dimensions). However, with broadcasting,
#NumPy automatically expands the smaller array so that it matches the shape of the larger array.
# Adding  the two elements
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])  # A 1D array
number = 5  # A single number

result = arr1 + arr2  # Broadcasting happens
print(result)
# Rules
#Rule 1: If the shapes match, perform the operation normally.
# Rule 2: If one array has a smaller dimension (like fewer rows or columns), NumPy expands it.
# Rule 3: If one dimension is 1, it gets stretched to match the larger array.
# Rule 4: If the shapes donâ€™t match in a way that allows stretching, NumPy throws an error.
arr1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])  # Shape (2,2)

#arr2 cannot be stretched to fit (2,2), so NumPy throws an error.

# Finding LCM of two numbers

# Multiples of 6:
# ðŸ‘‰ 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, â€¦
# The smallest common number in both lists is 12.
