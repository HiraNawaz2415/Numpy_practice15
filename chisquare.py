#The Chi-Square Distribution is used in statistics to test if data matches what we expect.
#âœ… Used to compare actual vs. expected results ðŸ“Š
# Larger values = bigger differences from expected
#  Common in hypothesis testing (e.g., Chi-Square Test)
#  Used in genetics, surveys, and quality control
# Finding relationships between two things
#Higher Chi-Square value = More difference from expectations
#  (e.g., "Do people who exercise daily eat healthier?")
#ðŸ’¡ Example:
# Imagine you survey 100 people about their favorite color:
# Expected results (equal preference): 25 like Red, 25 like Blue, 25 like Green, 25 like Yellow.
# Actual results: 20 like Red, 30 like Blue, 22 like Green, 28 like Yellow.
# Chi-Square helps us check if these differences happened by chance or mean something important.
#Ï‡ =âˆ‘ (Oâˆ’E)^2/E
#Main Parameters
#  df (degrees of freedom) â†’ Controls the shape of the distribution.
# More categories = Higher df = More spread-out distribution.
# size â†’ The number of values we want to generate.
# The graph starts near zero and extends to the right,
#  meaning small differences are common, but large differences are rare
